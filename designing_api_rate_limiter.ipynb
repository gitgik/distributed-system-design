    " # Designing an API Rate Limiter\n",
    "\n",
    "An API reate limiter will throttle users based on the number of requests they are sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Rate Limiting?\n",
    "Rate limiting helps to protect services against abusive behaviors targeting the application such as Denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, brute-force password attempts, brute-force credit card transactions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to prevent revenue loss, to reduce infrastructure costs, stop spamming and stop online harassment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some scenarios that show how benefitial it is to Rate limit our API/Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misbehaving clients:** Sometimes, clients can overwhelm servers by sending large number of requests, either intentionally or unintentionally. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security:** Limiting the number of times a user is allowed to try authenticating with a wrong password.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preventing abusive and bad design practices:** Without API limits, developers of client apps might request the same info over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue:**  Certain services might want to limit operations based on the tier of their customer's service and thus create a revenue model off the rate limiting. To go beyond the set limit, the user has to buy higher limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prevent spikiness of traffic so that the service stays reliably up for all.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Rolling Window Algorithm\n",
    "Here, the time window is considered from the fraction of time at which the request is made plus the time window length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our rate limit = 2 msg per sec, the two messages sent at the 300th millisecond (m1) and 400th millisecond (m2), we'll count them as two messages starting from the 300th of that second to the 300th of the next second (making up one second).\n",

    "Assume our rate limiter allows 3 requests/sec per user. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each unique user, \n",
    "- Keep a count representing how many requests the user has made\n",
    "- and a timestamp when we started counting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep this in a hashtable, where:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#  Key (userID): Value {count, start_time}\n",
    "hashtable = {\n",
    "    'userID0': {\n",
    "        'count': 3, 'start_time': 1574866492\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    'userId1': {\n",
    "        'count': 1, 'start_time': 1574873716\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a new request comes in, the rate limiter will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the `userID` is not present in hash-table, \n",
    "    - insert it, \n",
    "    - set `count` to 1 and set `start_time` to current epoch time\n",
    "2. Otherwise, find the existing record of the userID, and \n",
    "    - if `current_time - start_time >= 1 min`, set the `start_time` to be the current time, \n",
    "    - set `count` to 1 and allow the request\n",
    "3. If `current_time - start_time <= 1 min` and\n",
    "    - If `count < 3`, increment the count and allow the request.\n",
    "    - If `count >= 3`, reject the request.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Problems with this Fixed Window Algorithm\n",
    "1. We are resetting the `start_time` at the end of every minute, which means we can potentially allow twice the number of requests per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if a user sends 3 requests at the last second of a minute, they can immediately send 3 more requests at the very first second of the next minute, resulting in 6 requests in a span of two seconds. The solution for this would be a sliding window algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/fixed_window_problem.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Atomicity: The read and then write process can create a race condition. Imagine, a given user's current count = 2. If two seperate processes served each of these requests and concurrently read the count before either updated it, each process would erroneously think that the user had one more request to go hit the rate limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/fixed_window_atomicity.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solutions\n",
    "We can use Redis to store our key-value and solve the atomicity problem using [Redis lock](https://redis.io/topics/distlock) for the duration of the read-update operation. \n",
    "This however, would slow down concurrent requests from the same user and introduce another layer of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How much memory to store all the user data?\n",
    "Assume the userID takes 8 bytes, epoch time needs 4 bytes, 2 bytes for count:\n",
    "```\n",
    "8 + 2 + 4 = 14 bytes\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's assume our hash-table has an overhead of 20 bytes for each record. If we need to track 1 million users at any time:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total memory =  (14 + 20) bytes * 1 million => 34 MB memory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that we need a 4-byte number to lock each user's record to solve the atomicity problems, we would require a total of 38MB memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can fit in a single server. However, wouldn't like to route all traffic in a single machine. Also, if we want to rate limit 10 requests/sec, this would translate to 10 million QPS for our rate limiter. This would be too much to handle for a single server. Practically, we can use Redis or Memcached in a distributed setup. We'll store all the data in the remote Redis servers and all the Rate limiter servers will read/update these servers before serving or throttling any request.\n",

Let's take an example where we rate-limit at 500 requests/hour, with an additional limit of 10 requests/minute. *This means that when the sum of the counters with timestamps in the past hour exceeds the request threshold (500), the user has exceeded the rate limit.*\n",
